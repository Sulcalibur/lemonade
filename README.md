###Lets get started
Firstly, you'll want to link the stylesheets to your html file

```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/lemonade.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/styles.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/responsive.css">
```
###Let me run you through these sheets:
- lemonade.css is the main grid
- styles.css is your styles on top of your grid
- responsive.css is for mobile & tablet

###Structure
Once you have your stylesheets linked, you'll want to start structuring your
.html file â€” lets go...

```
<div class="frame">
	<div class="bit-2">Content here</div>
	<div class="bit-2">Content here</div>
</div>
```
###It's that easy.
So, in order to get the best results, you'll need to wrap each .bit- in a .frame class

.bit-2 is set 50% and will scale to 100% on mobile and tablet (Perfect for galleries)
